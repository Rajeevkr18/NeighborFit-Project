# 🏡 NeighborFit - Neighborhood-Lifestyle Matching Platform

Welcome to **NeighborFit**, a full-stack web application designed to help users find neighborhoods that match their lifestyle preferences using systematic research, real-world data analysis, and algorithmic thinking.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

NeighborFit addresses a core problem faced by many individuals and families: **how to choose the right neighborhood** that aligns with their lifestyle, preferences, and needs. Using research-driven hypotheses and a custom-built matching algorithm, this platform aims to simplify this complex decision-making process.

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### ✅ Functional Application
- Users answer questions about their lifestyle (e.g., commute, family size, amenities, safety).
- Real neighborhood data is processed to find best matches.
- Matching algorithm provides top 3 neighborhood suggestions.

### 🔍 Matching Algorithm
- Custom scoring logic based on weighted preferences.
- Handles missing or inconsistent data with fallback logic.
- Designed for scalability and modularity.

### 📊 Data Processing Pipeline
- Uses public datasets (e.g., census, Google Places API, crime data).
- Cleans and normalizes inconsistent datasets.
- Merges multiple datasets to produce a unified profile for each neighborhood.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Documentation

### 1. Problem Definition
Choosing the right neighborhood is often overwhelming due to:
- Too many variables (budget, schools, safety, commute, etc.)
- Lack of centralized data
- No personalized suggestion tools

### 2. Research & Hypothesis
**Hypothesis**: People prioritize different factors based on lifestyle. A personalized system can guide their neighborhood choice better than generic search tools.

**Methodology**:
- Surveyed 30+ users on neighborhood priorities.
- Studied platforms like Zillow, Niche.com, and WalkScore.

### 3. Gaps Identified in Existing Solutions
- Lack of personalization.
- Data not consolidated in one place.
- Complex interfaces, not beginner-friendly.

### 4. Algorithm Design & Trade-offs
- Chose weighted sum model for simplicity and interpretability.
- Trade-off between precision and explainability.
- Considered collaborative filtering but lacked enough user data.

### 5. Challenges & Solutions
- **Limited data**: Used free APIs and open datasets.
- **Missing fields**: Handled with default weights or omitted from scoring.
- **Budget constraints**: Built using open-source tools (React, Node.js, MongoDB).

### 6. Testing & Validation
- Manual testing on various edge cases (e.g., empty preferences).
- Validated matching logic with known preferences.
